                <h2>💡 The Minds Behind Java</h2>
                <p>
                    Java’s journey began in the mid-1990s with a small team at Sun Microsystems, and
                    since then, it has evolved into one of the most powerful programming languages ever
                    created. Here are a few remarkable individuals who shaped its history:

                        <h3>James Gosling</h3>
                        <p>
                            Known as the <b>“Father of Java”</b>, James Gosling designed Java in 1995 while
                            working at Sun Microsystems. His vision was to create a language that could
                            “write once, run anywhere”.

                            Co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Joy played a crucial role in Java’s architecture
                            and API design. He also contributed significantly to UNIX and the vi editor.

                            One of the original members of the “Green Team”, Naughton helped design the
                            first Java compiler and runtime environment, which made Java platform-independent.
