                <p>
                    Java‚Äôs journey began in the mid-1990s with a small team at Sun Microsystems, and
                    since then, it has evolved into one of the most powerful programming languages ever
                    created. Here are a few remarkable individuals who shaped its history:

                            Known as the <b>‚ÄúFather of Java‚Äù</b>, James Gosling designed Java in 1995 while
                            working at Sun Microsystems. His vision was to create a language that could
                            ‚Äúwrite once, run anywhere‚Äù.

                            and API design. He also contributed significantly to UNIX and the vi editor.
